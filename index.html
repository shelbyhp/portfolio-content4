      <p>Afrofuturism evaluates the past and future to create better conditions for the present generation of Black
        people through the use of technology, often presented through art, music, and literature. As Black activists
        demand for the abolishment of prisons and the dismantling of the police state, Afrofuturism emerges as a guide
        to push society into a future full of Black empowerment. “In Afrofuturism, we imagine ourselves and create whole
        worlds where we not only achieve greatness, but we are thriving in our own culture. There is a reason why films
        like Black Panther and novels written by Octavia Butler resonate so much in the African diaspora,” says Nova
        Sparks, author of the Dome trilogy. “We see the possibilities of a society of Black men and women that is
        steeped in our history, but also embraces our advancement while protecting both as a means for survival. Seeing
        this can and has inspired more of us to invest in our communities, to continue to dominate in the STEM field and
        the arts, and to move forward in our quest to reach back into our communities by creating opportunities and
        guidance for our youth.”</p>
