        <p> Participatory design is positioned as an approach to address community challenges and reimagine potential
          futures by decentralizing systems of power and centering the marginalized, moving away from designers as
          experts and framing design as being community-driven. Methods of speculative participatory design are useful
          in imagining futures among marginalized groups while negotiating existing societal constructs. While research
          probes have been developed to support the practice of speculation in design, we have yet to see research
          probes in HCI that consider the lived experiences of Black and brown communities. In this pictorial, we
          illustrate the process of developing methods cards as design probes to encourage speculative and critical
          design thinking from an Afrofuturism lens. We highlight how Afrofuturism centers Black communities in design
          speculation lending to both equity-driven design outcomes, and an accessible resource that can be readily used
          by designers and non- designers alike in addressing community concerns. </p>
        <p> Afrofuturism offers a potential antidote to this thesis. Complementary to (and often lacking in) speculative
          and critical design approaches such as science fiction prototyping (which uses science fiction to speculate on
          technology and the future), Afrofuturism facilitates a more empathic design engagement that explicitly places
          the often disenfranchised black voice central in the design narrative, with an intent of universal betterment
          through and by technology.</p>
