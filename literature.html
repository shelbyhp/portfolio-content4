        <p>Afrofuturism refers to a flourishing contemporary movement of African American, African, and Black diasporic
          writers, artists, musicians, and theorists. Afrofuturism comprises cultural production and scholarly
          thought—literature, visual art, photography, film, multimedia art, performance art, music, and theory—that
          imagine greater justice and a freer expression of black subjectivity in the future or in alternative places,
          times, or realities. It also offers speculation about a world wherein black people are normative. Afrofuturism
          can also imagine dystopic worlds to come, with contemporary injustices projected into, and often intensified
          in, the future. However, Afrofuturist works do not always look to the future but, rather, often unsettle
          notions of linear time. </p><br><br>

        <p> More broadly defined, Afrofuturism reimagines not only new forms of temporality but also new black
          experiences and identities via science and speculative fiction or other artistic and intellectual means. It
          often does so by exploring both the potential and the pitfalls of technoculture and posthumanism. Although the
          movement has certainly exploded in recent years, especially since 2000, its intellectual and aesthetic
          underpinnings can be traced back to mid- and late-19th-century African American novels that imagined
          alternative realities and communities for black people.
